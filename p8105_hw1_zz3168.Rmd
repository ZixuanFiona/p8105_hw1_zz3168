```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r}
library(moderndive)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
early_january_weather
```
In `early_january_weather` dataset contains information on weather conditions.

```{r}
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

the data set consists of `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns, and the The mean temperature in this dataset is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)` degrees.
